ðŸš— Real-Time GPS Tracking with Python, Kafka & Laravel
ðŸ“¡ How it works
GPS Devices â†’ Traccar Server

All cars send their live GPS data to a Traccar server.

Traccar â†’ Python + Kafka

Python fetches live locations from Traccar.

Kafka streams the data smoothly even if hundreds of cars are moving.

Kafka â†’ Laravel Backend

Laravel asks Python/Kafka only for the required carâ€™s location.

Each user only sees their own carâ€™s live location, not others.

Laravel â†’ Frontend

The frontend shows a real-time moving car on the map with smooth updates.

âœ… Why this setup?
Scalable â†’ Works for 1 or 1000+ cars without lag.

Reliable â†’ No data loss even if many cars send updates together.

Efficient â†’ Laravel stays lightweight and only deals with required data.
